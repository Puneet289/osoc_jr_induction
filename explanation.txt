The merge conflict:
-> The failure during the merge process indicates that there is a conflict between the local branch and the branch being merged.
In this case, Git resolves as much as possible, but there are things that have to be resolved manually in the conflicted files.
The merge conflict generally occurs when the file is accessed by two users and when one of them makes changes and other tries to merge the files.

Resolving the conflict:
->The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes(in this case removing all the conflict seperators).
->After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content.
->The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command.
->Git will create a new merge commit to finalize the merge.

->we can also use git reset command to resolve the merge conflict.
